# Crazy-Eight
This is Crazy 8 the card game. Itâ€™s meant to be played on terminal(for Linux) and command prompt(for Windows). Crazy 8 is really similar to Uno since players have to match a card that has either the same value or the suit of the top card of the deck. Players can play any card with the value of 8, and they get to declare the next suit for other players to follow. The winner is declared when that person runs out of cards on his/her deck.

How to compile:
-	Go to command prompt/terminal
-	Type: javac Card.java
-	javac Deck.java
- javac abstractDeck.java
-	javac crazy8.java
-	java crazy8
